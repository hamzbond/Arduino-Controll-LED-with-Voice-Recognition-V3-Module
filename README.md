# Arduino-Controll-LED-with-Voice-Recognition-V3-Module
This module doesn't use internet access. you can controll LED using microphone connected to the module

The module need to be trained before it is ready to use. and the ability to record voice is quite short (about 2 - 3 seconds) so you have to speak quickly and correctly.
But of course, it detects any language :v
